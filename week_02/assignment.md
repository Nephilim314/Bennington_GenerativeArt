### Assignment week 2

Have a look at the final example in week 2's sketches, p15_everything.  Your assignment is to modify the sketch in any two of the following three ways.

1) Add color variation to the animation along the same way that there exists variation frame-to-frame in the rectangle sizes.

2) Make the variables num_x and num_y vary frame-to-frame (either randomly or with a sine wave) instead of just changing when you hit the spacebar.

3) Add some sort of mouse interaction to the sketch so that the visuals change somehow when you move the mouse.
