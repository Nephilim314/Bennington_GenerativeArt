### Assignment week 4

Select one of these three options as your assignment for week 4.

1) research one of Vera Molnar, Frieder Nake, and Sol Lewitt. Find one of their works and try to reverse engineer it in p5.js. Please send me a link to the work you found (even a screenshot would be fine) and the program which demonstrates all or part of it.

2) create a new sketch from scratch which uses all three of:

 - noise()
 - lerp()
 - sin()


3) modify the example "p08_veraMolnar_gridLines_animate" in the following suggested way: animate it so that instead of just adding a line every 60 frames, it draws it gradually from one endpoint to the next.  hint, [see this code](https://github.com/genekogan/sfpc-code/blob/master/VeraMolnar_examples/veraMolnar_03_interpolated/sketch.js) (warning, it's more complex, but the solution is in there!).
